Working on Your Computer

    If youâ€™ve never used the command line, we recommend taking the Learn the Command Line course.
    Install Python by following the directions in this article on Installing Python.
    Download the Date-A-Scientist project.
    Unzip it by double-clicking on it.
    Navigate to the directory containing the project, and open dating_skeleton.py.
    This is where you will write your solution code.
    Follow along with the instructions in capstone_instructions.md
    Then, create a set of slides using Google Slides, Microsoft PowerPoint, or some other presentation software. If you want to, you can follow our presentation template, which has examples of the types of slides you may want to use.
    When you've completed the project, submit it for review!
